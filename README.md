New Year's Eve 2017 (2018) Laser Display
========================================

A really hacky, last minute show based off the one I wrote for
Atlanta's 2017 Beltline Lantern Parade.

This uses (poorly) vectorized samples from the open source
[Exo Font](https://github.com/NDISCOVER/Exo-1.0).

More Info
---------
For more laser projection code, check out the rest of my Github profile.
I've published a bunch of code written in Python and Rust.

I'll eventually have more resources available on [lasers.io](http://lasers.io).
